# Simple Website Directory Structure

This folder contains the basic structure of a simple website. All HTML files are stored in the same folder for easy navigation and management.

## Directory Structure:

### Pages and Navigation:

1. **index.html (Home Page)**:
   - Serves as the main entry point to the website.
   - Links to other pages: About Us, Services, and Contact Us.

2. **aboutus.html (About Us Page)**:
   - Provides information about the company/team.
   - Includes a link to navigate back to the Home Page.

3. **contactus.html (Contact Us Page)**:
   - Displays contact details with email and phone links.
   - Includes a link to navigate back to the Home Page.

4. **services.html (Services Page)**:
   - Highlights the services offered.
   - Includes a link to navigate back to the Home Page.


## Features Demonstrated:

### 1. **Navigation Between Pages**:
- Links (`<a href="filename.html">`) connect different pages in the same directory. 
- Use the `href` attribute to specify the file to navigate to.

### 2. **Contact Links**:
#### **Email Links (`mailto:`)**:
- Example: `<a href="mailto:info@website.com">info@website.com</a>`
- What it does:
  - Opens the default email client on the user's device.
  - Automatically pre-fills the "To" field with the specified email address.
- Use Case: Allows users to easily email the business.

#### **Phone Links (`tel:`)**:
- Example: `<a href="tel:+1234567890">+123-456-7890</a>`
- What it does:
  - Opens the phone dialer on mobile devices.
  - Pre-fills the dialer with the specified number for easy calling.
- Use Case: Provides a direct way for users to contact the business by phone.

## How to Use:
1. **Open the `index.html` file in a browser** to view the website.
2. Use the links in the navigation menu to explore other pages (`aboutus.html`, `contactus.html`, `services.html`).
3. **Click on email or phone links** in the `contactus.html` page:
   - Email links open your default email client.
   - Phone links open the dialer (mobile only).

## Notes:
- This structure is ideal for small websites or projects.
- The `mailto:` and `tel:` features are widely supported but may behave differently based on the user's device and settings.
