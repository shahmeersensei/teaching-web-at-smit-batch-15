# HTML5 - Intro to Basic HTML Tags

Welcome to the **HTML5 Intro to Basic HTML Tags** section! In this folder, we explore some fundamental HTML tags and elements, their purposes, and practical examples. Some of the tags demonstrated here may not be in active use in modern web development but are included for educational purposes to help understand the foundational structure of HTML.

## Tags Covered in This Section

This section covers various HTML tags that help structure and style content on a webpage. These tags are crucial for understanding the building blocks of HTML. Please note that while these tags are part of HTML5, some of them are not commonly used in modern web design practices. The focus is on understanding their historical context and learning the basics of HTML.

### 1. **Headings and Paragraphs**
- **Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)**: Headings are used to define titles or sections of content. The tag `<h1>` is the largest heading, and `<h6>` is the smallest.
- **Paragraph (`<p>`)**: Used for wrapping and structuring content into readable blocks of text.

#### Example:
**File:** `headings_and_paragraphs.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Headings and Paragraphs</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph. Itâ€™s used to organize text and make it easier to read.</p>

    <h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
    <p>Paragraphs break up content into readable chunks.</p>

    <h3>This is a Heading 3</h3>
    <p>Each heading has a different size. The smaller the number, the larger the heading.</p>
</body>
</html>



This README provides a structured overview of the HTML tags discussed, includes examples of how they are used, and provides context about their current relevance in the modern web development industry.
