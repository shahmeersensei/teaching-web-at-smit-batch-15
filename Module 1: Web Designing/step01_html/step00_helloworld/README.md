</body>
</html>

3. **`<head>`**  
   - The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the page, like the title and links to stylesheets or scripts (not visible on the page itself).
   - **`<title>`** inside the `<head>`: Sets the text that will appear on the browser’s tab. In this case, "My First HTML Page."

4. **`<body>`**  
   - The `<body>` section contains everything that appears on the webpage (visible content).
   - **`<h1>`**: This is a heading tag, and in this case, it displays "Hello, World!" on the webpage in large text.

5. **`</html>`**  
   - The closing tag for the `<html>` element. It marks the end of the HTML document.
