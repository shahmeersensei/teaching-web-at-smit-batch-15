# Navigate on the Same Page Using HTML

This file demonstrates how to navigate between different sections of the same page using only HTML.

## How It Works:
- **Anchor Links (`<a>`)**:
  - Use the `href` attribute to link to a specific `id` within the page.
  - Example: `<a href="#section1">` navigates to the section with `id="section1"`.
- **Section IDs (`id`)**:
  - Add an `id` attribute to each section you want to navigate to.

## Example:
1. Navigation Links:
   - `<a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>`
   - `<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>`

2. Sections:
   - `<section id="section1">...Content...</section>`

## How to Use:
1. Open the file in your browser.
2. Click the navigation links to jump between sections.
3. Enjoy smooth navigation without any CSS or JavaScript!
