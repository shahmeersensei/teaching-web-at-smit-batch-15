# HTML5 - Lists in HTML

Welcome to the **HTML5 Lists in HTML** section! In this folder, we explore different types of lists that you can create in HTML: numbered lists, bullet lists, and definition lists. Additionally, we will learn how to create **nested lists** where one list can be placed inside another.

This tutorial covers the basic concepts of HTML lists, their purpose, and how to structure them in a way that makes your content organized and readable.

## Types of Lists Covered in This Section

### 1. **Numbered Lists** (`<ol>`)
A **numbered list** is used to display a list of items in a specific order. It is created using the `<ol>` tag (ordered list) and the `<li>` tag (list item) for each item.

#### Example:
**File:** `numbered_list.html`

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Numbered List</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Top 5 Favorite Fruits</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Mango</li>
        <li>Pineapple</li>
    </ol>
</body>
</html>
```

## Notes on Outdated Tags and Current Practices

### Outdated Tags:
Definition List ```<dl>, <dt>, <dd>```
These tags are still valid in HTML5 but are rarely used in modern web development. Instead, developers prefer using other semantic elements like tables for structured data. However, these tags are great for understanding how lists can be used in HTML.
Bullet and Numbered Lists: The ```<ul> and <ol>``` tags are still widely used in modern development. However, be aware that for styling lists, CSS is commonly used today (e.g., using list-style-type to control bullet styles).

### Current Best Practices:
Semantic HTML: 
Always try to use semantic HTML tags ```<article>, <section>, <nav>``` to structure your content, instead of relying too heavily on list elements.
CSS for Styling: Lists often require styling to improve their appearance, typically done through CSS.

Happy coding! ðŸš€


### Explanation:

**Numbered Lists (`<ol>`)** are used when the order of items is important.
**Bullet Lists (`<ul>`)** are used when the order doesnâ€™t matter, just a collection of items.
**Definition Lists (`<dl>`)** are used for listing terms and definitions (not commonly used but important for educational purposes).
**Nested Lists** are useful when you want to include more detailed items within a list, like categories or sub-items.

The README provides a detailed explanation, examples, and tips for practicing each list type, and it mentions which tags are still valid but not as commonly used in modern web development.
