# 🌐 **Domain & Hosting Subscription – A Desi Guide**  

## 🏠 **What is a Domain?**  
A **domain** is the **address of your website** that people type in a browser to visit your site.  

### 🏡 **Desi Example: Domain as Your Home Address**  
Think of the internet as a big **city** and your website as a **house**.  
- Your **domain name** (e.g., `mywebsite.com`) is like your **home address**.  
- If someone wants to visit your website, they type your domain in the browser, just like people enter an address in Google Maps to find a house.  

### 📌 **Popular Domain Extensions:**  
| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `.com` | General websites & businesses |
| `.in` | Websites based in India |
| `.org` | Nonprofit organizations |
| `.net` | Networking or technology sites |
| `.edu` | Educational institutions |

## 🖥️ **What is Hosting?**  
Hosting is where your **website’s files, images, and data** are stored. Without hosting, your website **won’t be visible** on the internet.  

### 🏠 **Desi Example: Hosting as a Plot of Land**  
If your **domain is your home address**, then **hosting is the land** where your house is built.  
- **Without hosting** = You have an address, but no house.  
- **With hosting** = You have both an address and a house where people can visit.  

### 🏆 **Types of Hosting**  
| Type | Best For | Example |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Shared Hosting** | Small websites/blogs | Like renting a flat in an apartment |
| **VPS Hosting** | Medium businesses | Like owning a portion of a big house |
| **Dedicated Hosting** | Large businesses | Like owning an independent bungalow |
| **Cloud Hosting** | Scalable websites | Like renting multiple flats in different cities |
