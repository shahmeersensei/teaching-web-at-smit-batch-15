### **JavaScript `alert()` with a Desi Example**

### **💡 Desi Example:**  

Imagine your **Ammi (Mom) is calling you for dinner**. Instead of coming to your room, she **shouts from the kitchen**:  

📢 **"Beta! Khaana lag gaya hai!"** (Son! Food is ready!)  

This is exactly how `alert()` works! It **interrupts everything** and **demands your attention**.

### **💻 JavaScript Code Example:**  

```javascript
alert("Beta! Khaana lag gaya hai!");
```

🖥️ **What Happens?**  
When you run this code, a pop-up message appears in your browser saying:  

➡️ **"Beta! Khaana lag gaya hai!"**

### **📌 Another Fun Example:**  

Let's say your **friend owes you money**, and every time he opens your website, he gets a reminder.  

```javascript
alert("Oye! Paise kab wapas karega?");
```

📢 **"Oye! Paise kab wapas karega?"** (Hey! When will you return my money?)  

Your friend will see this pop-up message on the screen every time he visits your website. 😂

### **When to Use `alert()`?**  
✅ When you want to give an important message to the user.  
✅ When you need to **pause execution** until the user acknowledges the message.  
✅ When debugging simple code.

### **🚫 When NOT to Use `alert()`?**  
❌ If you use too many alerts, it can **annoy users** (Imagine Ammi shouting every 2 minutes 😅).  
❌ It **blocks the entire webpage** until the user clicks "OK".

### **🎯 Challenge for You:**  
Try writing an alert that welcomes users to your website in **your style**.  
Example:  

```javascript
alert("Swaagat nahi karoge hamara? 😎");
```

This will pop up a message saying: **"Swaagat nahi karoge hamara? 😎"** (Won’t you welcome me?)
